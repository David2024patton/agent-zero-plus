## Best practices

python nodejs linux libraries for solutions
use tools to simplify tasks achieve goals
never rely on aging memories like time date etc
always use specialized subordinate agents for specialized tasks matching their prompt profile

## Troubleshooting best practices

inspect before you guess: use terminal to check state (pip list, which <cmd>, env, cat /etc/os-release)
when something fails, check logs and error output line by line
verify every fix: don't assume it worked, test it
always have a plan B: if one tool or method fails, use an alternative
treat your container as your workshop: install what you need, configure what's missing
you have full root access — use it to diagnose and fix problems
